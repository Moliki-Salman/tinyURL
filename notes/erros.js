            triggerUncaughtException(err, true * fromPromise *);
            ^

[UnhandledPromiseRejection: This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). The promise rejected with the reason "false".] {
  code: 'ERR_UNHANDLED_REJECTION'
}

 when i used validUrl.isUri = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(invalidLongUrl), the finction was called once this time but it reponded with a 500 status code.;

*** const token = authorization.split(" ")[1]; TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split'): This error means that the postman need a validtoken.;
